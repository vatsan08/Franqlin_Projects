# 🛒 E-Commerce Website Frontend

A simple e-commerce website (frontend only) built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. The website includes:

- A **Welcome/Home Page**
- A **Login Page**    
- A **Registration Page**  
- Basic **input validation** using JavaScript  

This project is designed for learning and practice purposes to understand how static pages and DOM manipulation work in a real-world project.

## 📘 Project Overview  

This project simulates a basic frontend structure of an e-commerce platform. It focuses on the user journey from landing on the home page to registering or logging into their account. All navigation and validations are handled on the frontend using JavaScript — no backend is included.
